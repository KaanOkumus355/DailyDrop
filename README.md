## ☁️ Deployment

Live demo: https://dailydrop.onrender.com/

## 🗃️ Database

This app uses SQLite as the database, with a file named users.db.

You don’t need to create it manually — the database is automatically generated when the app runs for the first time:

    with app.app_context():
    
      db.create_all()

If you're running the app locally, a new users.db will be created in the instance/ folder.

Note: The users.db file is excluded from version control for privacy and security.
